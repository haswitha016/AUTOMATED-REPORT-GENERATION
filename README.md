##DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK(AUTOMATED-REPORT-GENERATION)
          This task focuses on developing hands-on experience in **automating business reporting** using Python. It is designed to help interns learn how to process structured data, analyze it, and create a professional report in PDF format. Through this task, I was introduced to working with data stored in CSV files, performing statistical analysis using `pandas`, and then generating a readable and formatted report using the `reportlab` library. This kind of automation can be very useful in real-world applications like sales reporting, analytics, or business performance tracking.
*Objective:*
The main goal of this task is to build a Python script that performs three main functions:
1. Reads sales data from a CSV file
2. Analyzes the data using the `pandas` library
3. Generates a structured, professional-looking PDF report using the `reportlab` library
By completing this task, I learned how to handle data files and generate dynamic reports automatically using Python code, without manually formatting anything.
*Technologies & Libraries Used:*
 Python – A powerful, beginner-friendly programming language used to implement this task
 pandas – A data analysis library used to read, manipulate, and analyze tabular data
 csv – A built-in Python module used to write sample sales data into a `.csv` file
 reportlab – A Python library for creating and formatting PDF documents programmatically
*How It Works:*
*1. Data Preparation (CSV Creation):*
The first part of the script generates a sample dataset manually and writes it into a file called `data.csv`. This dataset contains sales information such as:
  Date of sale
  Product name
  Units sold
  Revenue generated
This was done using the csv module in Python, which is suitable for writing simple rows of data in comma-separated format.
*2. Data Analysis using pandas:*
Once the dataset is prepared, the script uses the `pandas` library to read the CSV file. After reading the data into a DataFrame, it uses the `.describe()` function to generate summary statistics. This gives valuable insights like:
 Total number of entries
 Mean values (like average revenue)
 Minimum and maximum values
 Standard deviation
 These insights can help businesses better understand their sales performance.
*3. PDF Report Generation using reportlab:*
The final step involves creating a professional PDF report using `reportlab`. The script generates two separate reports:
 A *summary report*(`report.pdf`) containing statistical analysis like average sales, total revenue, etc.
 A *detailed report* (`sales_report.pdf`) displaying the entire dataset in a tabular format for easy reference
The PDF includes:
 A clear title
 Well-aligned headers
 Neatly formatted data rows
 Proper font sizes for readability
*Deliverables:*
 Task-2.py – Python script for automating report generation
 data.csv – Input dataset containing sample sales data
 report.pdf – Summary report with statistical insights
 sales_report.pdf – Complete tabular report of all data
*Conclusion:*
This task helped me understand how to automate the process of report creation using Python. I learned how to generate a dataset, analyze it using pandas, and then turn it into a professional PDF report using reportlab. It made me realize how useful automation can be for saving time and improving accuracy in reporting tasks. This was a great learning experience in data handling, formatting, and generating useful reports in real-time scenarios.
